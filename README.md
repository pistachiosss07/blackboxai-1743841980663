# Shop Sarisari

## Project Overview
Shop Sarisari is a web application designed to provide a platform for users to browse and purchase unique, handcrafted products from local artisans. The project features a user-friendly interface, showcasing popular products, and provides seamless navigation between various pages including Home, Shop, About, and Contact. 

The application is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, utilizing Tailwind CSS for styling and responsive design, alongside interactivity managed through JavaScript.

## Installation
To run the Shop Sarisari application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/shop-sarisari.git
   ```
   
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd shop-sarisari
   ```

3. **Open the `index.html` file in your web browser**:
   You can either double-click the file or open it using your preferred browser.

4. Optionally, if you want to serve the application using a local server (recommended for development), you can use any lightweight server like `http-server` or `live-server`. If you have `npm` installed, you can install `http-server` globally:
   ```bash
   npm install -g http-server
   ```
   Then run:
   ```bash
   http-server .
   ```

## Usage
Once the application is running, navigate through the pages using the navigation bar at the top. You can:

- Explore featured products in the Home section.
- Visit the Shop page to view a grid of products.
- Read about the mission and journey of Shop Sarisari in the About page.
- Get in touch via the Contact page.

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: The application is fully responsive, adapting to mobile and desktop sizes.
- **Product Showcase**: Users can view attractive product cards with images, descriptions, and prices.
- **Quick View Feature**: Users can quickly view product details in a modal without navigating away from the page.
- **Category Filters**: On the Shop page, users can filter products based on categories (e.g., Home Decor, Apparel).
- **Easy Navigation**: Clearly labeled links for easy access to Home, Shop, About, and Contact pages.

## Dependencies
The project uses the following libraries:

- **Tailwind CSS**: For utility-first CSS styling.
- **Font Awesome**: For icon fonts.

### Note:
You can find the CDN links in the `index.html` file.
